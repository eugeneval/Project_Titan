## Candidate 1 - Suhayl

#### Background
* Interested in Planes
* Design at GSCE, designed an air quality measuring box

#### Technical
* Talked about friction drag.
* Needed heavy prompting for form drag.
* Talked about mounting bags on outriggers.
* Needed some prompting for moments.
* Suggested using jet exhaust to reduce drag by creating turbulent flow

#### General
*

## Candidate 2 - Ibad

#### Background
* Built a robot that follows a path.
    * Did build, not programming.
* Created hydroelectric generator

#### Technical
* Suggested routing air to rear to avoid form drag.
* Realised very quickly propellers are for stability and navigation.
* Caught on to CG problem quickly.
* Struggled with pressure and form drags
    * Eventually realised
    * Suggested routing air to rear to reduce pressure difference.

#### General
* Could be more eloquent (so many 'like's).
* Caught on to new concepts well.
* Became more eloquent and confident as interview went on and switched to more technical subjects.

## Candidate 3 - Daniyal

#### Background
* Organised large football tournament - managing teams, resolving conflicts.
* Created a catapult 3 day challenge
* Knows how to work in a teams

#### Technical
* Routing air to rear of design
* Clearly done background research, knew about materials
* Understood CG problem
* Understood fluid dynamics issues
* So far the fastest to catch onto form drag

## Candidate 4 â€“ Ding

#### Background
* Did all science at A-level, high marks
* Internship at local bus manufacturing company
    * Shadowing only - no real work

#### Technical
* Understood needing to fill vacuum at back but wasn't sure why
    * Didn't mention pressure
* Understood CG problem
* Needed prompting to get to pressure
    * Grasped form drag ok

#### General
* *Quite loud*

## Candidate 5 - Antony

#### Background
* International student - mixed background
* Football and violin once or twice a week
* More focused on pure physics rather than applied

#### Technical
* Suggestions:
    * flaps to guide airflow
    * make body wider and longer to create spaces for payload
* Understood CG problem
* Prompting for pressure and form drag
    * After introduced to the concept seemed to catch on ok

#### General
* Raised interesting question about the need for vertical displacement of motors

## Candidate 6 - Matthew

### <span style="color:green">This is the guy</span>

#### Background
* Interested in drones from a young age
    * Made multiple hexcopter and quads
    * Killed a drone with a flock of birds
* Interested in aeronautics, drones, rockets

#### Technical
* Understood CG problem
    * Mentioned that stabilisation for too long would kill battery
* First one with a way of protecting the payload for landing
* Knows a lot about flight controllers and motors

#### General
* *Clearly cool since he has a skateboard*
* Very knowledgable about drones
* Did his research and background reading

BetaFlight, iNav?

## Candidate 7 - Arkadiy

#### Background
* Did a foundation course to catch up from Russian system
* Little experience but is interested
* Built a sauna
*

#### Technical
* Suggested putting payload at rear
* Using a magnetic lock to release payload
    * One of the few mention a release mechanism
* Initially assumed payload was a single mass
* Struggled with CG problem
    * **Really** struggled with CG problem
    * Turns out it was because he was trying to think of an attachment points
    * Did kind of ok when it was phrased as a pure weight problem

#### General
* *Insisted on handshake*
* Thinking is a little rigid, slow to adapt to new concepts

## Candidate 8 - Billy

### <span style="color:green">Probably slightly unfair to the first years, as he's really a third year, but this seems like our other guy</span>

### <span style="color:red">Only here until December</span>

#### Background
* Did general engineering
* Built a web app to do force and stress analysis on bridges
* Research and design on hoverboard like thing (double octo)
    * Testing of optimum length for contra-rotating propellers
    * Has experience with strain gauges, voltmeters, etc

#### Technical
* Understood the various problem:
    * CG
    * Drag
    * Clearance
    * Interference
* Knew about form drag

#### General
* **Brought a model and a flour bag**
* Clearly put in a lot of effort
* Knows what he's on about
* Eloquent and confident
