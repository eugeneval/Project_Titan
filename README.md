## Simulation

#### Start PX4 Simulation:
Go to Firmware folder.
Run `make posix jmavsim` to start in JMAVSim, or
`make posix_sitl_default gazebo` to start in Gazebo.
*__Note:__ these simulations are currently for the default quadcopter*

#### Control
Open QGroundControl. It will automatically connect and can be used to control the quad in the simulation. Alterntively, it can be controlled from the pxh console in the command line.
